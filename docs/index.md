## Summary

This app is a simple offline audio and music player for Android that focuses on making it easy to enjoy audio files and music. Its goal is to include all vital features, along with practical additional features, and exclude features that could confuse users or detract from their listening experience.

## Intended users

* People frustrated with music players that either lack key features or have too many unnecessary features

   > As someone who's tired of using music players that either have too many features or are missing key features, I want an app that'll have all I need and only little more, so that I can enjoy my music without frustration or confusion.

* People who seriously love listening to music and/or other audio on their Android device

    > As someone who deeply loves and appreciates the gift of sound, I want a practical and attractive audio player that allows me to listen my audio files, so that I can enjoy them along with all the useful features the app has to compliment the listening experience.

* People who casually listen to music and/or other audio on their Android device

    > As someone who sometimes listens to music and recorded speeches from my Android device, I want an attractive and easy-to-use audio player, so I can open it and get straight to listening to my audio files and music.

## Functionality

List (using a bullet list---or ordered list, if order is relevant) the key functional aspects that will be provided by the app---i.e. tell us what the user will be able to do using the app. This should not simply be a re-statement of the [summary](#summary), but should instead provide a more specific articulation of the functionality and user experience. 

## Persistent data

List, in general terms and using a bullet list, what content will be stored on the Android device. This should include any information that users of your app would expect to be maintained (i.e. without connection to a server) across multiple sessions of use. 
    
## Device/external services

If the client component will need to access special services of the device (e.g. sensors, contacts, messaging), list them here using a bullet list. Also, if the client component will need to access already-existing external services (e.g. real-time weather data, Open Movie Database, Open Trivia Database), those should also be listed here; any such references to external services should include links to the main page or API description page for the service.

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements 

If you can identify functional elements of the software that you think might not be achievable in the scope of the project, but which would nonetheless add significant value if you were able to include them, list them here. For now, we recommend listing them in order of complexity/amount of work, from the least to the most.
